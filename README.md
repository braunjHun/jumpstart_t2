To set up the project, you need node installed.

To install dependencies, run the following:

```sh
npm install
```

To run the tests, there is a script in the project root called `test`. It calculates code coverage, incorporates
watch mode, and prints in verbose mode, so all test file's test report will be visible. Alternatively, you
can achieve the same with the command the script contains:

```sh
npm test -- --watchAll --collect-coverage --verbose
```

# Instructions

## Mine	Sweeper	-	Game	Rules:		

You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you step 
on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to clear all the squares (without clicking on any 
bombs) you win. 
Clearing a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. 
If you guess a square contains a bomb mark it with a flag. 
A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the 
sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges. If you 
clear a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open; recursively. 
The first square you open could be a bomb. 
You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
