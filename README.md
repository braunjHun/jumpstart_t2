To set up the project, you need node installed.

To install dependencies, run the following:

```sh
npm install
```

To run the tests, there is a script in the project root called `test`. It calculates code coverage, incorporates
watch mode, and prints in verbose mode, so all test file's test report will be visible. Alternatively, you
can achieve the same with the command the script contains:

```sh
npm test -- --watchAll --collect-coverage --verbose
```
